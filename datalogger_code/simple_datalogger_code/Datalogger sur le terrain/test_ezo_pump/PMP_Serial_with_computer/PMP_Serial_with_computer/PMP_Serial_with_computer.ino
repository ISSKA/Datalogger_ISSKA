//This code was written to be easy to understand.
									 
//Modify this code as you see fit.
//This code will output data to the Arduino serial monitor.
//Type commands into the Arduino serial monitor to control the EZO-PMP Embedded Dosing Pump.
//This code was written in the Arduino 2.3.2 IDE
//An Arduino UNO was used to test this code.
//This code was last tested 9/24
